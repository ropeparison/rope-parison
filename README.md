A project to gather a database of all climbing ropes and display the data in a user friendly way for climbers to look at when considering getting a new rope.  
  
Secondary objectives:  
Present user friendly information about what the tests in the 'standards' actually look like.  
Examine the rope data to identify any interesting correlations and/or dispell misconceptions climbers have about rope properties.  
Look into using the data from triple rated ropes to create a spring-damper model of a rope.  
Expand to include static ropes and cords.
